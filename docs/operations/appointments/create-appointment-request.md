# Create appointment request

`POST /api/appointments/request` → `CreateAppointmentRequest`

A client submits an `AppointmentRequestDraft` carrying the signed
`offerToken` produced earlier by the business service's
`POST /api/service/quote` (`IssueServiceQuote`, read-only — not diagrammed
here) alongside only the requested slot and the ids of the employee and
services — no name, contact or pricing data travels from the client, and no
client id either: the caller never gets to assert whose client record a
booking attaches to, it is always the authenticated `userId`. Multiple
instances of the same service are requested explicitly, not by repeating an
id: `draft.services` is a `List<RequestedService>` (`serviceId` + `count`,
e.g. `RequestedService(serviceX, 5)` for 5 counts of service X), one entry
per distinct service — rejected up front with `SERVICES_VALIDATION_FAILED`
if any entry's `count` is not positive, or if the same `serviceId` appears
in more than one entry (a client must fold that into a single entry's
`count`, not send two entries for the same service). Once that shape is
validated, `draft.services` is already the distinct id + count map the rest
of the operation needs — no flattening — and it's compared directly against
the quote's claimed counts (`draft.services.associate { serviceId to count
}` vs. `claimedServiceCounts`). `IssueServiceQuote` still signs the *count
per distinct service id* into `QuoteClaims.CLAIM_SERVICES`
(`QuoteClaims.encodeServiceCounts` — `"<serviceId>:<count>"` entries) and
its own route still accepts a flat, possibly-repeated id list to derive
those counts from (unchanged, out of scope here) — only the draft's wire
shape is count-based. Once the signature and business id checks pass, the
employee, client and *distinct* services are resolved from the business
service in a single call to `GetAppointmentBookingContext`
(`BusinessClient.getAppointmentBookingContext`, given `businessId`,
`employeeId`, the caller's `userId` and the draft's distinct `serviceId`s —
one entry per service, not one per requested instance) — this is the
operation's actual authorization gate for *identity*: an employee that no
longer exists in the business, or a service that has since been removed,
fails here even if the signature check passed. The client side of that
resolution is a get-or-create keyed on `(businessId, userId)`
(`ClientDataSource.getClientByUserId`, falling back to
`ClientDataSource.getOrCreateIntegratedClient` seeded from the caller's
profile via `UserClient.getUserById` on the very first booking with this
business) inside the same call — so a first-time client is provisioned
without appointments ever needing to know or store a client id itself, and
without a second round trip to business. Only once that context is
resolved does the operation expand it back into one `Service` per requested
instance itself, matching each resolved distinct service against its
`RequestedService.count` (`context.services.associateBy { it.id }`, then
`draft.services.flatMap { List(count) { resolvedService } }`) — business
never sees or returns a repeated-by-count list, appointments is the only
side that needs individual instances, to build one `ServiceSnapshot` per
instance. The full `AppointmentRequest` (with real `EmployeeSnapshot`,
`ClientSnapshot`, one `ServiceSnapshot` per instance) is then built and its
total price *and* total duration compared against the token's frozen
values — the quote signs both
(`QuoteClaims.CLAIM_TOTAL`, `CLAIM_DURATION`), so a service whose duration
changes after the quote was issued (even if its price didn't) is caught the
same way a price change is, instead of silently booking a
longer-or-shorter slot than the client agreed to. There is no business-permission check on
top of this, since the caller is the client booking with the business, not
a staff member. If the business has `automaticApproval` on, the request is
approved immediately by delegating into [Create appointment from a pending
request](create-appointment-from-request.md)'s shared verify/persist logic
instead of being stored as pending.

**Consumed by:** `AppointmentEvent.RequestCreated` → [notifications: notify the
employee](../notifications/on-appointment-request-created.md). The
`automaticApproval` branch delegates into [Create appointment from a
pending request](create-appointment-from-request.md)'s shared logic and
sends `AppointmentEvent.RequestApproved` instead — see [notifications:
notify the client of
approval](../notifications/on-appointment-request-approved.md).
