# Operation activity diagrams

One Mermaid activity diagram per HTTP route that mutates state (every
`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` route backed by a business operation), plus
one per asynchronous reaction to a cross-service Kafka event, grouped by
microservice. Each route's KDoc carries a `See:` line pointing at its file,
so the diagram is reachable both from here and from the route handler in
the code. Every diagram whose operation sends a cross-service event ends
with a **Consumed by** line linking forward to the diagram(s) that react to
it; every reaction diagram links back to the producer(s) that fire it, so
following either direction from any file traces the whole cascade.

Read-only (`GET`) routes and routes with no persisted side effect (e.g.
issuing a signed quote token) are out of scope — see [Database ER
diagrams](../database/README.md) for the schema those mutations write
to. Background operations that run on a timer instead of a route or event
are documented separately in [Scheduled (recurring)
jobs](scheduled-jobs.md).

## Cross-service event map

Every event that crosses a service boundary, who fires it, and who reacts.
`AuthEvent.UserDeleted` is the widest fan-out in the system — four services
react to a single account deletion, independently and in no guaranteed
order.

|---|---|---|
| `AuthEvent.UserDeleted` | [Delete account](authorization/delete-account.md) | [appointments](appointments/on-user-deleted.md), [business](business/on-user-deleted.md), [notifications](notifications/on-user-deleted.md), [user](user/on-user-deleted.md) |
